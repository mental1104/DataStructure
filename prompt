Repo notes (Codex CLI)
- Benchmarks: main executable now `bench/bst/ds_bench` (was bst_bench). Compares AVL, RedBlack, Splay, BTree, BPlusTree, BStarTree, QuadraticHT, Skiplist; extra scenarios include Skiplist range-scan, BStarTree sequential-insert/light-read, and small MT coarse-lock random access. HashLinear currently disabled due to severe clustering/perf issues.
- Latest perf highlights (default workload: size=400k, access=800k, locality=1.2M, insert=erase=400k, seed=42):
  - Random Access: BTree/BPlusTree ~160–200 ns/op best; AVL/RB ~335–340; Splay/BStar/Skiplist/HashQuad 600–1000+.
  - Random Insert: Splay fastest (~98 ns), AVL/RB/BPlus/Skiplist 170–296 ns, BStar ~1.8 µs, HashQuad ~5.4 µs.
  - Random Erase: HashQuad ~67 ns/op (bucket clear), BPlus ~573, AVL/RB ~800–980, BStar/Skiplist 1400–2000+.
  - Locality: Splay ~12 ns; AVL/RB 14–15; B+/B*/BTree 55–64; Skiplist/HashQuad 100–133.
  - Update Heavy: BPlus ~285 ns best; AVL/RB 350–430; Skiplist ~498; others slower.
  - Read Heavy: BTree ~168 ns, BPlus ~210; AVL/RB ~340–360; HashQuad ~393; BStar/Skiplist 680–860; Splay 1100+.
  - Range Scan: HashQuad ~7.8 ns/op fastest; RB/BTree/AVL ~28–50; BPlus/BStar/Skiplist/Splay slower. Uses full sequence insert then sliding window scan.
  - Seq Insert + Light Read: BTree/BPlus/HashQuad/AVL/RB 280–520 ns; Skiplist/BStar/Splay 900–2600 ns (current impl overhead high). Uses full sequence insert then 100k random reads.
  - Seq Bulk Insert: full sequence insert timing; Splay ~29 ns/op, RB/AVL/HashQuad 47–237, BTree/BPlus ~370–430, Skiplist ~264, BStar ~2.8 µs (BStar/Skiplist still dominated by overhead).
  - MT Random Access (coarse lock, small scale): HashQuad 164 ns; AVL/RB/BPlus ~440–520; BStar/Skiplist ~1 µs.
- BPlusTree: header-only implementation under `src/include/btree/BPlusTree.h` adapted from CMU 15445 B+ tree.
- BStarTree: custom B*-like tree in `src/include/btree/BStarTree.h`, inherits BST; basic correctness, slower constants.
- Hash tables: linear probing `Hashtable.h`, quadratic probing `HashtableB.h` (QuadraticHT); linear probing has unresolved perf issue for large random workloads.
- Skiplist: `src/include/ht/Skiplist.h`.
- Tests: gtest-based under `test/`; specific tree tests include `test_bstar_tree.cpp` etc.
- Build: top-level CMake; benchmarks built when ENABLE_BENCHMARKS=ON. Bench CMake in `bench/bst/CMakeLists.txt`.
